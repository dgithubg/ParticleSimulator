If everything worked fine you should see two windows. The first window is an 
OpenGL window. The second window is a Tcl shell


The executable is created in the "Build" folder. You can run the main program 
outside Visual Studio by running the file "anim.exe"

Interaction

- Moving the mouse with the right button pressed rotates the scene.
- Moving the mouse with the middle button pressed zooms the scene

The following key strokes are recognized:

- r	restore the original view
- 0	reset all systems
- a	toggle animation
- s	toggle simulation        *****
- m	toggle frame dumping
- t	reset all timers
- q	quit
- h	print these instructions


Custom scripts
------------

You can run your own scripts by using the shell command "source <script_path>"


Try out the Project :
-------------------

* Select existing scripts from the Tcl shell window by navigating to /scripts
   * A good example is a complex cube found at /scipts/cube_complex.tcl

* Use the mouse to click on points and drag them around, before or during simulation
